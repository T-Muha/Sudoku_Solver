# sudoku-solver

Console-based Sudoku solver that uses elimination and two-level guessing. Written in Python without any additional modules.
To run, simply have Python installed and execute the main file "SudokuSolver.py"

There are many included levels to select from. I have not yet found any level that this program cannot solve.
